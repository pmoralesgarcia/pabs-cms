# pabs-cms
A CMS that is modular with the core of the system running the backbone. The modular portion is creating different parts such as blogging, IndieWeb technologies, external storage, etc. Each module must follow a standard to be able to connect to the core of the CMS.

## Roadmap (Will be updated consistently)
* Decide programming language
* Look at examples for inspiration
* Create system core
* Must be in Docker Container
====== No particular order ======
* Create API
* Create Blog Module
* Create Node Module
* Create RSS Module
